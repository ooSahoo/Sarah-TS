# View user activity

Mosaic provides a log for user actions, such as when a user is created or logs in to an app. The log includes the time the event occurred and when applicable, the ID of the user who created the event, the ID of the app in which the event was created, and IP address of the user's device.

## View or search for events

From **User Activity**, you can view user events. You can filter the events using the search box at the top of the page. Events can be filtered by date and time, event type, country, and the user who created the event. Use [advanced search queries](/guides/risk/recommendation_queries.md) to refine results and tailor them to your specific needs. <!--You can also click ![](../../images/action_icon.svg) to view the raw event data.-->
