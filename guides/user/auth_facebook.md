# Login with Facebook

## Overview

Facebook Login can be used to authenticate users, or create new users based on their email address.

:::attention Note
If you are looking for the backend-to-backend integration, see [Login with Facebook (backend-initiated)](/guides/user/be_auth_facebook.md).
:::

Here's how it works:
![](../../images/UserID/auth_facebook_flow.jpg)

1. User clicks login button, sending request to `/auth/facebook` with `client_id` and `redirect_uri`
1.  Mosaic redirects to Facebook login page, which authenticates user and redirects back to Mosaic.
1. After validating the response, Mosaic redirects back to your `redirect_uri` with a code.
1. Your application sends the code to your backend, which exchanges it for token.
1. Upon a successful exchange, the user is logged in.

## Step 1: Set up Facebook credentials

Facebook credentials must be configured in the App Dashboard as follows:
- Create an App ID by registering your app. Youâ€™ll also need to set your Redirect URL to ` https://api.transmitsecurity.io/cis/auth/facebook/callback`.
- Obtain the App Secret that corresponds to the app you registered.

:::info Note

The App ID and App Secret will be configured later in the Mosaic Admin Portal.

:::

## Step 2: Enable Facebook for app

1. Login to the Mosaic Admin Portal
1. Go to **B2C** or **B2B Identity** _based on your setup_ > **Authentication methods**
1. Expand the **Facebook** settings.
1. Fill in the client ID and client secret using the App ID and App Secret retrieved from Facebook in Step 1.

## Step 3: Add redirect URI to app

To redirect back to the redirect\_uri provided in the initial request, it should be registered in your application settings in Mosaic Admin Portal. From the Admin Portal under **Applications**, click on your application to edit your OIDC client settings and add this URI under **Redirect URIs**.  If you don't already have an application, you'll need to create one first (see [Create application](create_new_application.md)).

:::info Note

Your application settings contain the Client ID and Client Secret for your application, which you'll need for Step 4 and 5.

:::

## Step 4: Initiate Facebook login

Use a [request](/openapi/user/social-login/#operation/startFacebookAuth) like the one below to initiate an authentication flow using Facebook, described in the sequence diagram above. The `create_new_user` parameter will determine if this flow applies to new users, or only to existing ones. If set to `true` (and [public sign-ups](/guides/user/manage_apps/#advanced-settings) are enabled for this application), a new user is created if no user is found for the email returned by Facebook in the next step. The `redirect_uri` should correspond to the one added in step 3, and the `client_id` can be found from the Mosaic Admin Portal in the application settings.

:::info Note

Upon successful authentication, the browser will be redirected to the redirect URI along with a code to exchange for tokens in the next step.  For example, if `https://domain.com/verify` is your redirect URI, then Mosaic will redirect to `https://domain.com/verify?code=123abc`. However, if an authentication error occurs after redirecting to Facebook, the redirect URI will contain the error instead.

:::

```shell
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.transmitsecurity.io/cis/v1/auth/facebook?
     client_id=2eb840f.test.Transmit.io&
     redirect_uri=https://www.example.com/login&
     create_new_user=true' \
     --header 'Accept: application/json'
```
## Step 5: Get user tokens

To exchange the code received from Mosaic for an ID and access token, your server should send a POST request like the one below to the Mosaic [/oidc/token](/openapi/user/oidc/#operation/oidcToken) endpoint. Replace placeholders with the code you received in Step 4, your redirect URI, and your client credentials that can be found in your application settings from the Mosaic Admin Portal.

```shell
curl -i -X POST \
  https://api.transmitsecurity.io/oidc/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d client_id=CLIENT_ID \
  -d client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET \
  -d code=CODE \
  -d grant_type=authorization_code \
  -d redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
```
