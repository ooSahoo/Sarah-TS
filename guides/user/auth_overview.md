# Authentication & authorization overview

Build frictionless and secure authentication experiences for your users across all their devices and channels.

- Use **journeys** to create identity experiences with easy-to-use graphical interface and Mosaic SDK.

- Use an **OIDC-based approach** to authentication if you're interested in the classic OIDC integrations initiated from the browser, such as Mosaic's hosted login experience.

- Use **backend-initiated approach** to implement integrations leveraging [Backend Authentication APIs](/openapi/user/backend-one-time-login/#operation/sendMagicLinkEmail).

## Biometric authentication
Based on the [FIDO2 WebAuthn](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/) standard, biometric login is secure, consistent, and convenient for your customers. Launch fast with a fully hosted experience, or use our APIs/SDKs with your custom UI.

On mobile devices, consider implementing authentication with device sensors, such as Face ID or fingerprint.

|Authentication method |OIDC-based |Backend-initiated |Journey-based |
|--------------------- |-----------|------------------|-------------- |
| Log in with passkeys (WebAuthn) |Not supported|[Guides](/guides/webauthn/key_concepts/) |[Guide](/guides/orchestration/journeys/authenticate_passkeys/) |
| Log in with mobile biometrics |Not supported|[Guides](/guides/user/be_auth_biometrics_android/) |[Guide](/guides/orchestration/journeys/authenticate_mobile_biometrics/)|

</div>

## One-time login
Log in users using a one-time code sent to their phone or email, or magic link sent to their email. This passwordless option allows users to log in to a device that doesn't support WebAuthn biometrics, or a device that doesn't belong to them.

## Time-based passcodes
Log in users using time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP) generated by authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Twilio Authy.

</div>

## Push notifications

Log in users with push notifications sent to their trusted device.

## Social login
Social login allows customers to quickly authenticate with their existing social media accounts. Add this into your app to provide a fast and easy way for your customers to sign up, and minimize friction at checkout.

## Password login
Password login allows you to authenticate users with a username and password, so you can smoothly migrate your customers from passwords to a passwordless solution.
