title : "Get client access tokens"
description : "Mosaic APIs are authorized using Bearer access tokens in the header of the request. These tokens are retrieved from the oidc/token endpoint (defined by the OIDC standard) using your app's client credentials. The tokens are JWT tokens and are valid for one hourâ€”you can reuse tokens multiple times when calling Mosaic APIs during this hour. For the token structure, see our Token reference."

<Info>
To authorize operations across all apps of your tenant, you'll need a **admin access token**. This is a token retrieved using client credentials that corresponds to a Management Application created from the **Settings** page of the Admin Portal.
</Info>

## Retrieve access tokens

To retrieve a client access token, send the following HTTP POST request:


```shell
curl -i -X POST \
https://api.transmitsecurity.io/oidc/token \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d grant_type=client_credentials \
-d client_id=[CLIENT_ID] \
-d client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]
```

where `[CLIENT_ID]` and `[CLIENT_SECRET]` should be substituted with your app's client credentials. They can be found from the Mosaic Admin Portal by selecting your application from **Applications**. If you don't already have an application, you'll need to create one first (see [Create application](/guides/user/create_new_application/)).

<Info>

- When generating access tokens for **Detection and Response** or **Identity Verification** services, target them to the relevant resources by passing their URLs in the `resource` parameter. See [Authorization](/openapi/token/)
- With the `resource` parameter, you can restrict access to a specific resource within your application. A resource should be configured for this application (see [Manage resources](/guides/user/manage_resources/) ). The targeted resource will be reflected in the audience ( `aud` claim) of the access token.
</Info>

## Check token expiration

Client access tokens are valid for one hour since the time they were generated. Since they are JWT tokens, you can check expiration from the `exp` claim of the token. Expired client access tokens cannot be refreshed.

Here are some basic claims included in the token:

| Claim | Description |
| --- | --- |
| sub | Subject of the token. This is the client-id |
| iss | Issuer, identifies the principal that issued the JWT |
| aud | Audience, identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for |
| exp | Expiration time, in epoch time format. The token will not be accepted on or after this time |
| iat | Issued At, identifies the time the JWT was issued. |
