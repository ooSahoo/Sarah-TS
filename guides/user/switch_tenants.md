##

An admin can have access to several tenants in the same environment. For example, the admin may manage CIAM solutions for different customers, or a customer may decide to have several different tenants for business reasons.

You can see the current tenant that's selected and switch between different tenants in the [Admin Portal](https://portal.transmitsecurity.io/) by clicking the tenant name in the upper-left corner:
