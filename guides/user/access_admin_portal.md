# Access to Admin Portal

Creating Mosaic integrations starts in the Admin Portal&mdash;a centralized UI that provides admins with access to all Mosaic solutions and tools.

## Supported browsers

- Google Chrome™ (latest stable version)
- Mozilla® Firefox® (latest stable version)
- Microsoft® Edge (latest stable version)
- Apple® Safari® (latest stable version)

## Environments

Depending on environment and your region, select the Admin Portal to use:

- For production integrations:
    - [Portal for global customers](https://portal.transmitsecurity.io/) (global, located in US)
    - [Portal for EU customers](https://portal.eu.transmitsecurity.io/) (located in EU)
    - [Portal for CA customers](https://portal.ca.transmitsecurity.io/) (located in CA)
- For safe testing and development:
     - [Sandbox portal](https://portal.sbx.transmitsecurity.io/)


## Tenants

An admin can have access to several tenants in the same environment. For example, the admin may manage CIAM solutions for different customers, or a customer may decide to have several different tenants for business reasons.

You can see the current tenant that's selected and switch between different tenants in the [Admin Portal](https://portal.transmitsecurity.io/) by clicking the tenant name in the upper-left corner.
