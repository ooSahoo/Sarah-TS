# Conversational analytics

##

Use our **Conversational analytics** tool to collect data from your Mosaic app using natural language. This generative-AI based tool can be asked insights about your app's data, allowing you to collect intelligence for analytics purposes.

Data can be returned as text, or in the form of tables, graphs and visuals, based on the type of question. Responses can be exported in CSV to facilitate offline analysis.
