---

Mosaic’s navigation has been **redesigned for clarity and efficiency**, making it easier to find exactly what you need. Instead of grouping features by **technical service types**, the new interface is structured around **real-world solutions**, aligning with how you actually use the platform.

This means that instead of jumping between multiple sections to configure an identity experience, you’ll now find **everything you need in one place**, based on your specific use case. Here's an overview of the changes, more details below!


## A shift from services to solutions

**Previously**, Mosaic’s navigation was organized around **services**, requiring users to know which technical category a feature belonged to before accessing it. For example, when setting up a **B2C Identity**, you had to manually configure settings across multiple sections, such as **Identity Management**, **Authentication**, and **Orchestration**.

**Now**, Mosaic’s navigation is structured around **solutions**, grouping everything related to a business use case into a single, intuitive category. In the same example, the new **B2C Identity** section now includes all necessary settings in a single dedicated section, eliminating the need for separate configurations.

Instead of navigating between services, you now work **within a solution**, creating a more intuitive experience for setting up and managing your workflows.

## Customize your navigation

The new navigation isn’t just better—it’s **yours to control**. With built-in customization options, you can:

- **Show or hide sections** that aren’t relevant to your project.
- **Rearrange the menu** to keep your most-used tools in a prominent position.

Simply use the **navigation customization panel** (accessible via the toggle settings) to create a setup that works best for you.

      maxWidth: '100%',
      height: 'auto',
      borderRadius: '5px',
      display: 'block',
      margin: '2rem auto'
    }}
  />
</a>

## Why this matters

- **More intuitive navigation** – Find what you need, when you need it.
- **Faster access to essential tools** – Spend less time searching and more time building.
- **A personalized experience** – Focus only on what matters to your workflows.

This new approach makes Mosaic **smarter, simpler, and more aligned with your goals**—because great identity management shouldn’t be complicated.
