title : "Create a client SDK journey"
description : "Client SDK journeys are the simplest journey type, designed for workflows that require client-side interactions, such as collecting user input, performing device operations, or presenting authentication methods. These journeys run within your client application and leverage the Mosaic SDK."
---

This tutorial provides an introduction to building client SDK journeys, guiding you through creating a user with an email and password, and authenticating the user using auto-generated client-side codeâ€”no app development needed. Ready to start?

<Tip>
We highly recommend watching the [Journeys 101](/guides/orchestration/getting-started/journey101/) video course first as it provides visual guidance on how to create journeys, add and move nodes, run a test journey, etc.
</Tip>

## Create app

To integrate with Mosaic, configure an application in the [Admin Portal](https://portal.transmitsecurity.io/application/create) as shown below. For example:

- **Application name**: My demo app
- **Protocol**: OIDC
- **Client name**: Demo client
- **Redirect URIs**: `https://demoapp.com/verify`
- **Authentication method**: Client secret

Upon saving, Client ID and Client Secret are generated automatically. You'll need them for running the client-side.

## Exercise 1: Create user

Create and execute the journey that collects user details and creates a user:

### Create journey

Start by creating a blank client SDK journey. You can do it in the Admin Portal, by proceeding to **Orchestration** > **Identity journeys**.

### Add 'Get information from client'

Add the "Get information from client" node that collects an email and password from the user. Complete its configuration as follows:

- Set the **Step ID** to `userForm`
- Keep the schema as is
- Keep the default name for the output variable (`clientData`)

### Add 'Register password'

Add the "Register password" node that sets the password for the user record and creates the user if none exists. Complete its configuration as follows:

- Set **User Auth State** to "The user is not authenticated..."
- Set **external User ID** to `clientData.userEmail`
- Set **Password** to `clientData.userPassword`

### Run the journey

After saving the journey, you can test the flow. One option is to run the journey in the browser using the **Test journey** button. The other option is to download the code and then run it locally. When running the code locally, provide the Client ID and Secret you obtained in [Create app](/guides/orchestration/getting-started/client_sdk_tutorial/#create-app) step.

Upon initializing the journey, you'll see the default UI provided by Mosaic. You can proceed to submit user details, for example, "user@demoapp.com", "MyPassword123$".

### View user profile

Having created the user, go to **Identity Management** > **Users** in the [Admin Portal](https://portal.transmitsecurity.io/identityManagement/users) to view the user profile.

## Exercise 2: Login user

Create and execute the journey that allows a user to enter their credentials and authenticates a user with a password:

</Frame>

### Create journey

Start by creating a blank client SDK journey. You can do it in the Admin Portal, by proceeding to **Orchestration** > **Identity journeys**.

### Add 'Login form'

Add the "Login form" node that allows a user to enter their credentials. Complete its configuration as follows:

- Keep the **Step ID** as is
- Disable all authentication methods except **Password**
- Set the output variable to `loginData`

The "Password authentication" node is added automatically and is configured to use credentials stored in the `loginData` variable.

### Run the journey

After saving the journey, you can test the flow. One option is to run the journey in the browser using the **Test journey** button. The other option is to download the code and then run it locally. When running the code locally, provide the Client ID and Secret you obtained in [Create app](/guides/orchestration/getting-started/client_sdk_tutorial/#create-app) step.

Upon initializing the journey, you'll see the default UI provided by Mosaic. You can proceed to submit the credentials of the user you created in [Exercise 1](/guides/orchestration/getting-started/client_sdk_tutorial/#exercise-1-create-user), for example, "user@demoapp.com", "MyPassword123$".

### View user activity

Proceed to **Events** / **User Activity** to see events related to this user. You'll see the user login event.

## Next steps

### Want to continue playing with Identity Orchestration?

Consider combining the journeys you created into a single flow and adding more authentication options.

### Want to delete the fake user you created?

There's nothing like a good clean-up. You can do this from the Admin Portal. From **Identity Management** > **Users**, hover over your user in the user list, click<Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" iconType="solid"/> on the right, and click **Delete**.
